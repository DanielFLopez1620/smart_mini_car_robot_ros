# Elegoo Car V3 Gazebo

## Overview

Package related to the simulation with Gazebo for the description defined in the [elegoo_car_v3_description](/elegoo_car_v3_description/) package, where you can explore simulated worlds with the car that is sold by [ELEGOO].

**Keywords:** smart robot, gazebo, simulation, ROS.

The *elegoo_car_v3_gazebo* package has been tested under [ROS] Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04.
This is a educational project, which purposes on demostrating the capabilities of ROS and [Arduino] for robotics, and explore other capabilities of ROS related with simulations.
## Installation

### Installation from Packages

To install all packages from the this repository, make sure you have configured the [elegoo_car_v3_description](/elegoo_car_v3_description/) and its dependencies. Then, make sure to install the next packages:

    sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-gazebo-ros
	sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-gazebo-ros-control

Finally, you can make sure you have installed all the dependencies with:

	sudo rosdep install --from-paths src

### Building from Source

#### Dependencies

- [Robot Operating System (ROS)](http://wiki.ros.org) (Middleware for robotics),
- [Gazebo-ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/gazebo_ros_pkgs) (Interface for using the Gazebo simulator with ROS)
- [Turtlebot3_gazebo](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot3_gazebo)(To interact with different worlds already created)

#### Building

To build from source, clone the latest version from this repository into your catkin workspace and compile the package using

	cd <your_workspace>/src
	git clone https://github.com/DanielFLopez1620/smart_mini_car_robot_ros.git 
	cd ../
	rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src
	catkin_make
# Usage

This packages has different launches related to the simulation of a robot, for example, running the robot in a empty world with:

	roslaunch elegoo_car_v3_description elegoo_car_v3_world_xacro.launch
# Launch files

* **elegoo_car_v3_simple_room.launch:** Launches the elegoo car in a closed room with 6 tables, for interacting with the robot while running the **teleop_twist_keyboard** node.

* **elegoo_car_v3_world_urdf.launch:** Launches an empty world with the elegoo car model that uses the plain urdf generated by [sw_URDF_exporter] and modified to use controllers and other properties in gazebo, which is ready to relate with other nodes. The next video is a showcase along with the [teleop_twist_keyboard] node.

* **elegoo_car_v3_world_xacro.launch:** Launches an empty world with the elegoo car model that uses xacro (remember that this model has a little less accurate physics than the plain urdf), which is ready to relate with other nodes. The next video is a showcase along with the [teleop_twist_keyboard] node.

All the files, relates to the almost the same number of topics, in gereal they are listed below:

## Subscribed Topics

* **`/cmd_vel`** ([geometry_msgs/Twist])

	The command velocity for the robot,that can be linked, for example, with the teleop_twist_node.
## Published Topics

* **`/tf`** ([tf2_msgs/TFMessage])

	Related to the transforms of the model present in the URDF/Xacro definitions

* **`/odom`** ([nav_msgs/Odometry])

	Odometry of the robot. Related to the estimation of the current position based on the movements realized. This is implemented by the controller/plugin used in the xacro/urdf file.

Note that there must be other topics realted to gazebo and rviz that are omitted here.

## Services

The ones related with the getters and setters of the links present in the simulation, and others that works for the simulation properties and status, like physics.
